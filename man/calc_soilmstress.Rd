\title{Calculates an empirical soil moisture stress factor}
\usage{
calc_soilmstress(soilm, meanalpha = 1, apar_soilm = 0, bpar_soilm = 0.685)
}
\arguments{
\item{soilm}{Relative soil moisture as a fraction 
of field capacity (unitless). Defaults to 1.0 (no soil moisture stress).}

\item{meanalpha}{Local annual mean ratio of 
actual over potential evapotranspiration, measure for average aridity. Defaults to 1.0.}

\item{apar_soilm}{(Optional, used only if \code{do_calc_soilmstress==TRUE}) Parameter determining the 
sensitivity of the empirical soil moisture stress function. Defaults to 0.0, the empirically fitted value
as presented in Stocker et al. (2019) Geosci. Model Dev. for model setup 'FULL' (corresponding to a setup
with \code{method_jmaxlim="wang17", do_ftemp_kphio=TRUE, do_calc_soilmstress=TRUE}).}

\item{bpar_soilm}{(Optional, used only if \code{do_calc_soilmstress==TRUE}) Parameter determining the 
sensitivity of the empirical soil moisture stress function. Defaults to 0.685, the empirically fitted value
as presented in Stocker et al. (2019) Geosci. Model Dev. for model setup 'FULL' (corresponding to a setup
with \code{method_jmaxlim="wang17", do_ftemp_kphio=TRUE, do_calc_soilmstress=TRUE}).}

\value{
A numeric value for \eqn{\beta}

\description{
Calculates an empirical soil moisture stress factor as a function of relative 
soil moisture (fraction of field capacity).
}
\details{
The soil moisture stress factor is calculated using a quadratic function that
is 1 above \code{soilm} = 0.6 and has a sensitivity, given by the y-axis cutoff, 
(zero soil moisture), determined  by average aridity (argument \code{meanalpha}) as:
\deqn{
    \beta = q(\theta - \theta*)^2 + 1
}
for \eqn{\theta < \theta*} and \eqn{\beta = 1.0} otherwise. \eqn{\theta*} is fixed at 0.6.
\eqn{q} is the sensitivity parameter and is calculated as a linear function of average aridity, 
quantified by the local annual mean ratio of actual over potential evapotranspiration, termed 
\eqn{\alpha}:
\deqn{
     q=(\beta0-1)/(\theta*-\theta0)^2
}
\eqn{\theta0} is 0.0, and 
\deqn{
     \beta0 = a + b \alpha
}
\eqn{a} is given by argument \code{apar}, \eqn{b} is given by argument \code{bpar}.

## relative soil water content ('soilm') of 0.2:
